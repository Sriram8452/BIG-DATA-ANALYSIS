### DESCRIPTION: 

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using patient medical records and machine learning techniques. Heart disease is a significant global health concern, and early diagnosis is crucial to reducing mortality rates. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on manual analysis, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The objective of this project is to analyze various health attributes, identify patterns, and develop predictive models to classify patients based on their risk of heart disease. The dataset used in this project consists of various medical parameters such as age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, and other key indicators. The workflow begins with data loading and preprocessing, where missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and features are normalized to ensure consistency in model training. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the distribution of data, correlation between variables, and the impact of different attributes on heart disease. Data visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices help in understanding the dataset better. The machine learning phase involves training models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines to classify patients as having heart disease or not. These models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness. The best-performing model is selected for final predictions. The project also includes feature importance analysis to understand which factors contribute the most to heart disease. Running this project requires setting up a Python environment with necessary dependencies. First, the repository must be cloned from GitHub, and the required libraries should be installed using the requirements.txt file. The project runs on Jupyter Notebook, where the user can execute each cell sequentially to preprocess the data, train models, and visualize results. The execution process involves loading the dataset, performing EDA, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training machine learning models, evaluating performance, and generating predictions. The results are displayed in the form of tables and charts that highlight key findings such as the most influential health factors, accuracy of different models, and classification reports. The project provides valuable insights into heart disease prediction by identifying crucial health parameters that influence the likelihood of developing heart disease. By leveraging machine learning, this project offers an automated, data-driven approach that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making. Future improvements can include hyperparameter tuning for better model optimization, integration with real-time patient data for continuous monitoring, and testing with larger datasets for more generalized predictions. In summary, this project demonstrates the power of data science in healthcare, showing how machine learning techniques can be applied to predict heart disease accurately. The structured workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, ensures reliable results, making this a valuable tool for medical practitioners and researchers interested in predictive analytics.
